        <h2>Not Your Average Dev Shop</h2>
        <p>
          Say hello to <strong>BLUEHOUSE BV</strong>, the web dev rebellion
          where suits are banned, and code is poetry. Our 12-strong crew of code
          poets, UX witches, and performance nerds lives for:
        </p>

        <ul class="features">
          <li>
            <h3>Speed Obsession</h3>
            <p>
              Average Lighthouse score of 98/100. Our sites are faster than your
              Wi-Fi on a good day.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Code Nirvana</h3>
            <p>
              So clean, your grandma could debug it. We write maintainable code
              that doesn't make future devs cry.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dad Jokes Mastery</h3>
            <p>
              Mandatory skill for every hire. Our Slack is 50% memes, 50%
              commits.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="fun-fact">
          <p>
            <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Our CEO once fixed a production bug while
            skydiving at 12,000 feet. Our CTO optimized an SVG during a 72-hour
            hackathon without sleep. And our office parrot, Semicolon, squawks
            every time we miss a <code>;</code>. True stories, zero cap.

            <h3>SPA That Don't Suck</h3>
            <p>
              Single-Page Apps with buttery-smooth transitions, not
              soul-crushing spinners. We use Astro + Petite-Vue to craft sites
              that feel alive but weigh less than a JPEG of a banana. Bonus: Our
              SPAs survive even the sketchiest 3G connections.

            <h3>eCommerce That Converts</h3>
            <p>
              Online stores that don't scream "Shopify clone." Custom carts,
              1-click upsell flows, and checkout pages so slick, users forget
              what cart abandonment means. We've boosted conversion rates by 25%
              for clients who dared to dream big.

            <h3>Websites That Google Loves</h3>
            <p>
              SEO isn't black magic‚Äîit's our playground. Semantic HTML, image
              compression voodoo, and JSON-LD so rich it makes Google's crawlers
              swoon. Your site will rank higher than a cat video on YouTube,
              guaranteed.

            <h3>Legacy Code Rescue</h3>
            <p>
              Got a jQuery spaghetti monster from 2012 haunting your codebase?
              We'll refactor it into modern ES6, keeping your business logic
              intact. No heart attacks, no tears. Just clean, future-proof code
              that doesn't make your devs quit.
